The mechanism, borne out by recent neuroscience studies, is something like this:</p><ul class=\"postList\"><li name=\"e851\" id=\"e851\" class=\"graf--li\"><em class=\"markup--em markup--li-em\">New information creates a rush of dopamine to the brain, a neurotransmitter that makes you feel good.</em></li><li name=\"20e1\" id=\"20e1\" class=\"graf--li\"><em class=\"markup--em markup--li-em\">The promise of new information compels your brain to seek out that dopamine rush.</em></li></ul><p name=\"0422\" id=\"0422\" class=\"graf--p\">With fMRIs, you can see the brain&#x2019;s pleasure centres light up with activity when new emails arrive.</p><p name=\"e75e\" id=\"e75e\" class=\"graf--p\">So, every new email you get gives you a little flood of dopamine. Every little flood of dopamine reinforces your brain&#x2019;s memory that checking email gives a flood of dopamine. And our brains are programmed to seek out things that will give us little floods of dopamine. Further, these patterns of behaviour start creating neural pathways, so that they become unconscious habits: Work on something important, brain itch, check email, <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">dopamine</em>, refresh, <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">dopamine</em>, check Twitter, <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">dopamine</em>, back to work. Over and over, and each time the habit becomes more ingrained in the actual structures of our brains.</p><p name=\"c8b3\" id=\"c8b3\" class=\"graf--p\">How can books compete?</p><h3 name=\"60ae\" id=\"60ae\" class=\"graf--h3\">Pleasing ourselves to death</h3><p name=\"20d6\" id=\"20d6\" class=\"graf--p graf--empty\"><br></p><p name=\"ca35\" id=\"ca35\" class=\"graf--p\">There is a famous study of rats, wired up with electrodes on their brains.

They&#x2019;ll take the dopamine over sex. Some studies see the rats pressing the dopamine lever 700 times in an hour.</p><p name=\"d47a\" id=\"d47a\" class=\"graf--p\">We do the same things with our email. Refresh.

Books have always been an escape, a learning experience, a saviour, but beyond this, greater than this, certain books became, over time, a kind of glue that holds together my understanding of the world. I think of them as nodes of knowledge and emotion, nodes that knot together the fabric my self. Books, for me anyway, hold together who I am.</p><p name=\"d97b\" id=\"d97b\" class=\"graf--p\">Books, in ways that are different to visual art, to music, to radio, to love even, force us to walk through another&#x2019;s thoughts, one word at a time, over hours and days. We share our minds for that time with the writer&#x2019;s. There is a slowness, a forced reflection required by the medium that is unique. Books recreate someone else&#x2019;s thoughts inside our own minds, and maybe it is this one-to-one mapping of someone else&#x2019;s words, on their own, without external stimuli, that give books their power. Books force us to let someone else&#x2019;s thoughts inhabit our minds completely.</p><p name=\"d373\" id=\"d373\" class=\"graf--p\">Books are not just transferrers of knowledge and emotion, but a special kind of tool that flattens one self into another, that enable the trying-on of foreign ideas and emotions.</p><p name=\"9075\" id=\"9075\" class=\"graf--p\">This suppressing of the self is a kind of meditation too&#x200A;&#x2014;&#x200A;and while books have always been important to me on their own (pre-digital) merits, it started to occur to me that &#x201C;learning how to read books again,&#x201D; might also be a way to start weaning my mind away from this dopamine-soaked digital detritus, this meaningless wash of digital information, which would have a double benefit: I would be reading books again, and I would get my mind back.</p><p name=\"c0e9\" id=\"c0e9\" class=\"graf--p\">And, there are, often, beautiful universes to be found on the other side of the cover of a book.</p><h3 name=\"56e3\" id=\"56e3\" class=\"graf--h3\">The problems with digital stuff</h3><p name=\"360f\" id=\"360f\" class=\"graf--p graf--empty\"><br></p><p name=\"efef\" id=\"efef\" class=\"graf--p\">Recent neuroscience confirms many of the things we sufferers of digital overload know innately.

They are adept at navigating the rapidly evolving and shifting technological landscape. They make intuitive decisions amidst information-abundance, where sparse facts mingle loosely with data-drenched opinions. Full stack employees are capable of speaking design lingo, know that using <a href=\"http://www.comicsanscriminal.com\" data-href=\"http://www.comicsanscriminal.com\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"nofollow\">Comic Sans is criminal</a>, and are adept at making mocks in Keynote, Sketch, or Skitch (if it comes to that). And they know <a href=\"http://www.helloerik.com/ux-is-not-ui\" data-href=\"http://www.helloerik.com/ux-is-not-ui\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"nofollow\">the difference between UI and UX</a>.</p><p name=\"1434\" id=\"1434\" class=\"graf--p\">They can cross the aisle to talk to engineering and can make sense of algorithms, programming, and instinctively understand that scaling the backend isn&#x2019;t the same as scaling the frontend. Though they may not code for production, they understand what <a href=\"http://github.com\" data-href=\"http://github.com\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"nofollow\">GitHub</a> and <a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com\" data-href=\"http://stackoverflow.com\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"nofollow\">StackOverflow</a> are for, and can brute force a copy-paste script to perform basic analysis on a CSV file. If they must.</p><p name=\"1549\" id=\"1549\" class=\"graf--p\">They&#x2019;re on the latest social apps, and know how to self-promote. Tastefully (most of the time; for the rest, there&#x2019;s Snapchat). They use narrative and storytelling to involve their audience, but have watched enough three minute Kickstarter videos to know that they need to get to their point in less time than it takes to watch an Instagram video, if not a Vine. Attention is the currency of the age.</p><p name=\"db32\" id=\"db32\" class=\"graf--p\">Full stack employees have an insatiable appetite for new ideas, best practices, and ways to be more productive and happy. They&#x2019;re curious about the world, what makes it work, and how to make their mark on it. It&#x2019;s this aspect above others that defines and separates the full stack employee from previous generations. Full stack employees can&#x2019;t put blinders on once they land a job; instead they must stay up on developments in their industry and others, because they know that <a href=\"https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/techreports/UCAM-CL-TR-760.pdf\" data-href=\"https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/techreports/UCAM-CL-TR-760.pdf\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"nofollow\">innovation is found at the boundaries between disciplines</a>, not by narrowly focusing in one sphere.</p><h4 name=\"21e4\" id=\"21e4\" class=\"graf--h4\">What it&#x2019;s like to be a full stack employee</h4><p name=\"5dc7\" id=\"5dc7\" class=\"graf--p graf--empty\"><br></p><p name=\"096f\" id=\"096f\" class=\"graf--p\">Being a full stack employee isn&#x2019;t necessarily easier or harder; it&#x2019;s different. With always-on connectedness via their mobile devices, the boundaries between work and non-work blur, creating an implicit expectation that there&#x2019;s never a time too late for a Slack chat or Google Hangout. This may or may not work out well. YMMV.</p><p name=\"f6d8\" id=\"f6d8\" class=\"graf--p\">With constant internet access comes constant distraction (tragically in the form of another time-wasting listicle on being more productive). And since much of their work involves slicing through thick ambiguity&#x200A;&#x2014;&#x200A;they&#x2019;re given to radical clarity in certain lifestyle choices, from adopting <a href=\"https://vimeo.com/111171647\" data-href=\"https://vimeo.com/111171647\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"nofollow\">monolithic, monochromatic wardrobes</a> to <a href=\"http://www.soylent.me\" data-href=\"http://www.soylent.me\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"nofollow\">functional culinary choices</a>:</p><figure name=\"0070\" id=\"0070\" class=\"graf--figure\"><div class=\"aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked\" style=\"max-width: 640px; max-height: 640px;\"><div class=\"aspect-ratio-fill\" style=\"padding-bottom: 100%;\"></div><a href=\"https://instagram.com/p/0VrCxnS3r2/?taken-by=soylent\" data-href=\"https://instagram.com/p/0VrCxnS3r2/?taken-by=soylent\" class=\"graf-imageAnchor\"><img class=\"graf-image\" data-image-id=\"1*pUZ443PNRFeJRX4p1YJWQw.jpeg\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"640\" src=\"/image/5369494da6542bc9bb1499f8c13170a84c2dcc91.jpeg\"></a></div><figcaption class=\"imageCaption\"><a href=\"https://instagram.com/p/0VrCxnS3r2/?taken-by=soylent\" data-href=\"https://instagram.com/p/0VrCxnS3r2/?taken-by=soylent\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--figure-anchor\" rel=\"nofollow\">Photo</a> by Soylent</figcaption></figure><p name=\"039b\" id=\"039b\" class=\"graf--p\">Being full stack is an exercise in shifting between opposite poles. While there&#x2019;s often less support for individual work and a greater expectation of self-sufficiency (i.e. setting their own hours, using their own devices for work, etc), they&#x2019;re also expected to collaborate and work in groups effectively. Previously, you&#x2019;d have an IT manager select the technology for a large team, but with the increasing reliance on self-provided mobile devices, individuals are left to figure out how to communicate across and connect over different platforms. Indeed, <a href=\"http://slack.com\" data-href=\"http://slack.com\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"nofollow\">Slack</a>, the winningest enterprise tool <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">du jour</em>, <a href=\"https://slack.com/integrations\" data-href=\"https://slack.com/integrations\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"nofollow\">integrates with <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">everything</em></a>, <a href=\"http://www.economist.com/news/business/21647612-once-dominant-software-giant-determined-prove-life-begins-again-40-opening\" data-href=\"http://www.economist.com/news/business/21647612-once-dominant-software-giant-determined-prove-life-begins-again-40-opening\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"nofollow\">opposite Microsoft&#x2019;s latter-day strategy</a> of privileging its own platform over all others. These days, if you haven&#x2019;t integrated with everyone else&#x2019;s API, you&#x2019;re already behind. And that&#x2019;s true of full stack employees too&#x200A;&#x2014;&#x200A;they must have at least passing knowledge of all the latest apps lest they fall behind and as a result, out of the loop.</p><p name=\"b7b3\" id=\"b7b3\" class=\"graf--p graf--last\">Yet full stack employees are expected to deeply understand their domain, but also dynamically deal with shifting priorities and expectations. While not an altogether new phenomenon, the flat nature of many organizations means that pull can come from the top or the bottom, and it&#x2019;s up to the individual to prioritize one over the other. To evaluate these requests, the FSE stretch across traditional organization boundaries, while not get stretched <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">too</em> thin. They need to be informed about what everyone else is doing without micromanaging them, and not get uncomfortable working in roles unfamiliar to them: product manager, designer, communicator, strategist, advertiser, consultant, technologist, user advocate, marketer&#x2026; et cetera and so on!</p></div></div></section><section name=\"1683\" class=\" section--content\"><div class=\"section-divider layoutSingleColumn\"><hr class=\"section-divider\"></div><div class=\"section-content\"><div class=\"section-inner layoutSingleColumn\"><h4 name=\"58d5\" id=\"58d5\" class=\"graf--h4 graf--first\">Why it&#x2019;s great to be a full stack employee</h4><p name=\"584e\" id=\"584e\" class=\"graf--p graf--empty\"><br></p><p name=\"1d98\" id=\"1d98\" class=\"graf--p\">Despite the challenges of being a full stack employee, there are many upsides.

They also have a broader range and variety of experiences owing to the collaborative, interdisciplinary nature of their work. They have increasing influence across the organization, as their voice is raised in more conversations, and carry a deeper personal responsibility for the company&#x2019;s success, and are invested in the entire team&#x2019;s success.</p><h4 name=\"58f9\" id=\"58f9\" class=\"graf--h4\">What does this mean for employers and managers?</h4><p name=\"67e1\" id=\"67e1\" class=\"graf--p graf--empty\"><br></p><p name=\"1520\" id=\"1520\" class=\"graf--p\">A competitive market for full stack employees has considerable implications for companies and managers.

Third, do you provide flexible work hours, or support for alternative scheduling options?

In <a href=\"http://brt.hr/DEJX5W\" data-href=\"http://brt.hr/DEJX5W\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"nofollow\">these environments</a>, people of all kinds of backgrounds come together in a common space to work around and with each other. They&#x2019;re often online, connected on Slack or some other collaborative conversational platform (or several; note: <a href=\"https://medium.com/message/doomed-to-repeat-it-fb03757dfcca\" data-href=\"https://medium.com/message/doomed-to-repeat-it-fb03757dfcca\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\"><em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">email is dead</em></a>). Most coworking spaces are setup for ad hoc collaboration, with the right mix of virtual and physical tooling (whiteboards, projectors, conference rooms, video conferencing gear, etc). All of these support virtual team communication and collaboration.</p><p name=\"2a1d\" id=\"2a1d\" class=\"graf--p\">Perhaps unintuitively, the most necessary shifts for employers and managers is towards <a href=\"http://chadfowler.com/blog/2014/01/19/empathy/\" data-href=\"http://chadfowler.com/blog/2014/01/19/empathy/\" class=\"markup--anchor markup--p-anchor\" rel=\"nofollow\">empathy</a>&#x200A;&#x2014;&#x200A;both <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">for</em> this new kind of employee, but also <em class=\"markup--em markup--p-em\">from</em> them, in making specific demands on how they communicate and collaborate, and how expectations are set between them and you. Just because they demand a high degree of flexibility and autonomy doesn&#x2019;t mean that they get to dictate the criteria by which their work is evaluated.

Certainly the nature of work is changing, and the highest value employees are those who can handle ambiguity and synthesizing enormous amounts of information into strategically useful tactics.</p><p name=\"2714\" id=\"2714\" class=\"graf--p graf--last\">Moreover, we&#x2019;re only a decade into, and before, the widespread presence of working robots.
